You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

Explanation:
This question is edge case galore.

You first need to do all your checks if the length of the flowerbed is 1.
If it is 1, then you need to check for whether the flowerbed is already filled, or if it isnt.
Then you need to check for the value of n

Then you need to iterate through the flowerbed , splitting the checks for before and after each cell to include
the starting cell and the ending cell as well.

Thereafter check for value of n, if its 0 , answer is true, otherwise answer is false.
