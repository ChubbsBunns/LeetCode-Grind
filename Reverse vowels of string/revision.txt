Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"

Explanation:
First you have to keep a list of vowels. I used a set for easy lookup
Then create a new string variable as an array to store the original string.
(Because Python is stupid and doesnt allow for in place string manipulation)


Then iterate through the string and ensure that left and right indexes dont extend past each other.
In each loop, check if I have found a vowel on the left, and then check if I have found a vowel on the right.
If i have done this, then swap the values in the newly created string variable.

Reparse the array variable back into a string, return the string.
