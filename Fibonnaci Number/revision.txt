The Fibonacci numbers, 
commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, 
called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is 
the sum of the two preceding ones, 
starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

//Explanation
Since we only need to calculate the value, we just need to remember the previous 2 answers.
Hence We temporarily store the previous two numbers, updating them as we go.
Then return the last number once we have reached it.
Also, we need to put         
if n == 0 | 1:
    return n

For base cases.
