There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.

Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.

Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Explanation:
Iterate through the list to find the largest number of candy a single child has.
Find the minimum number to reach that number.
Iterate through the list again and append true or false depending if they are above or below that number.
