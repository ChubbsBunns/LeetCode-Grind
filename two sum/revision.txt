Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

 // Explanation
 First introduce an empty dictionary.
 Then iterate through all the numbers of the list.
 For each number, find the difference between the number and the required value.
 If this difference exists, that means the answer is the index of the diff, and the current index.

Hence check if the difference is in seen (seen is the dictionary)
If it is in seen, and the seen is not the current index (so it prevents duplicates)
that means we found our answer. 
Otherwise, add the value to seen.
