Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.

Implement the SeatManager class:

SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.
int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.
 
 Explanation:
 We need a data structure that allows us to remove and add a specific number fast.
 Furthermore, there is a requirement to read/remove a minimum/maximum number.
 Hence just use a priority queue.
 Whenever a min max requirement arises, just use a priority queue.
